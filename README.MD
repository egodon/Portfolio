## Portfolio

[ I stopped using this site as my portfolio since I feel like it needs to be rebuilt and improved. ]


I built this website to showcase my projects and to try and improve my sense of design. I tried the "mobile first" approach since I read
that it's a common way to building websites nowadays. Making this helped me understand the challenges of responsive design even with the help of a CSS framework.

Frameworks and libraries used:
* MaterializeCSS
* PostCSS
* Jquery
